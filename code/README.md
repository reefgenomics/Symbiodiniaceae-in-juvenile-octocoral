This folder has two different codes. 
1. The original code that was uploaded on the first submission (Revise-code)
2. the code used to create the figures on the revised submission.

The codes for Figures 2 and 3 are almost similar. but figure 1 has been revised. 

It is also possible to view the code as R script or with the HTML doc.

The code uses files that are found in the raw_files.rar.
